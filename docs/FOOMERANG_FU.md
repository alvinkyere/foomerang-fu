# FOOMERANG FU — combat skeleton (Fu Slice 1)

Status: v0.1, **engineering complete, not yet play-reviewed**. Package: `games/foomerang-fu`. This is the smallest loop that can answer one question — *can movement + throwing + a returning boomerang + a kill feel good on a phone controller?* — and nothing more. No dash, catch mechanic, powerups, hazards, maps, character art, music, scoring, accounts or menus.

Presentation is primitive and original: circles/shapes, a chevron, a triangle, rings and a banner. Nothing is taken from Boomerang Fu.

## The loop

```
MOVE (joystick)  +  THROW (button)
        │
        ▼
 boomerang HELD ─throw─► THROWN ─range reached / wall─► RETURNING ─touches owner─► HELD
        │                    │                              │
        └──── kills an enemy it overlaps (never its owner; never while HELD) ────┘
        ▼
 DEATH ─► last one standing wins the round ─► 2.5 s ─► deterministic reset ─► next round
```

## Where things live

| Concern | Where | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rules (state, step, boomerang machine, rounds) | `games/foomerang-fu/src/rules` | Pure and deterministic: no DOM, React, Phaser, Socket.IO, clock or randomness (lint-enforced). Depends on `game-core` only. |
| Player movement | `game-core` `step` | Fu composes it; it does not reimplement movement. |
| Input freshness, who is connected, button event ids, the 1/60 s accumulator | `apps/console/src/runtime/fuRuntime.ts` | The rules never see a clock or an event id. |
| What to draw | `apps/console/src/render/fuView.ts` (pure) | Rules state → view. |
| Drawing | `apps/console/src/render/phaser/PhaserArena.ts` | Presentation only; reads the view, never the rules. |
| The THROW button | manifest → `ActionButton` in the controller | Rendered because the manifest says so; no per-game branch. |

Deviation to note: Fu's drawing lives in the console's existing Phaser module (shared with the primitive arena, which uses the same circles and labels) rather than `games/foomerang-fu/src/render`. The boundary is the same (view model in, pixels out). Moving Fu-specific drawing into the game package later is a mechanical change.

## State (`FuState`, plain data)

`config` · `round` · `phase` (`PLAYING` | `ROUND_OVER`) · `elapsed` · `world` (game-core bodies = player positions) · `players` (`id`, `slot`, `alive`, `facing`) · `boomerangs` (one per player: `ownerId`, `state`, `position`, `direction`, `travelled`) · `roundOver` (`winnerId` or undefined for a draw, `resetInSeconds`).

Death is the rules fact `alive: false`. How it looks (dimming, the cross, rings) is the renderer's business and is never read back.

## The boomerang state machine

`HELD → THROWN → RETURNING → HELD`, and nothing else. The simulation moves a boomerang only through `transition()`, which throws on an impossible move (a bug, never a game state); `BOOMERANG_TRANSITIONS` is exported and tested. There is deliberately no "caught" or "dead" state: catching *is* RETURNING → HELD, and a dead owner's boomerang keeps its state.

## Step order (`stepFu(state, inputs, dt) → { state, events }`)

1. **Movement and facing** (alive players only; game-core moves the bodies).
2. **Throws**: only from HELD, only for the boolean `true`, only for living players. The boomerang starts just outside its owner, in their facing direction.
3. **Flight**: a boomerang thrown this step does not also move this step.
4. **Hits**, resolved *simultaneously* against end-of-step positions.
5. **Round end.**

`dt` follows game-core's contract (0 is a no-op; negative/non-finite/too large is a `RangeError`). Inputs are keyed by player id, unknown ids are ignored, and the order of the input `Map` never changes the outcome (players are processed in the order the match was created).

## Decisions (each a hypothesis to be judged by playing)

| Decision | Current value | Why / what to watch |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Throw direction | The last **meaningful** movement direction (outside the dead zone). A player who has never moved faces the **centre of the arena**. | No aim stick yet. Does "throw where I last walked" feel natural, or do you keep throwing the wrong way? |
| Owner policy | A boomerang **never kills its owner** — at the throw, in flight, or on the way back. | The simplest safe rule. Is self-kill-on-return a missing source of tension? |
| Hit geometry | Circle overlap, distance **strictly less than** player radius + boomerang radius (36 + 14). Exactly touching is a miss. | Is the hitbox readable and fair? |
| Death | Any hit by an enemy boomerang in THROWN or RETURNING kills. A boomerang flies on through a hit. | A dead owner's boomerang in flight stays lethal to others. |
| Simultaneous hits | All resolved together: both can die in the same step, which is a **draw**. | Rare, but must be unambiguous. |
| Return | Straight line toward the owner's **current** position; caught on touching distance (≤ 50). | Does returning feel like a threat the opponent must watch? |
| Rounds | Over when ≤ 1 player is alive (needs ≥ 2 players at the start; one player never ends a round). 2.5 s later everyone is reset to spawn, alive, boomerang in hand. | Is 2.5 s the right pause? Everything is frozen during it, including a boomerang caught mid-air. |
| Speed / range | Player 420 u/s · outbound 900 u/s · return 1000 u/s · range 520 u · arena 1600 × 900 u. Out ≈ 0.58 s, back ≈ 0.6 s. | The knobs most likely to need changing. All in `DEFAULT_FU_CONFIG`. |

No randomness is used yet, so there is no seed; when randomness arrives it must come in through explicit state, as with everything else.

## THROW through the platform

`THROW` is a manifest button whose `action` is `PRIMARY`. Pressing sends one `INPUT_EVENT` (pressed), releasing sends one (released), each with its own event id:

- **Holding sends nothing more** (no auto-repeat). A 2.4-second hold in the browser sends exactly one press and one release.
- The controller **never retries or queues**: a press made while the connection is down is dropped, not fired later.
- The server drops any event id it has already seen (a hostile replay of one id reaches the host once); the console remembers the last 64 ids per player as a second line of defence, and the rules are idempotent anyway (a throw while the boomerang is away does nothing).
- A press becomes a one-step `throw: true` request on the next simulation step that actually runs; a press from a player who is reconnecting is dropped, never remembered.
- RELEASE does nothing for Fu (it is carried for games that need it).

## Presentation (all derived, none fed back)

- Each player: colour + number + **shape** + name (colour is never the only cue).
- **Aim indicator** (triangle at the facing direction): solid while the boomerang is in hand, an outline while it is away.
- A flying boomerang: a spinning chevron in its owner's colour with a short fading trail.
- Brief rings for throw, catch, hit (plus a flash) and round start; the dead are dimmed with a cross; a banner names the round's winner (or "Draw"); "Round N" top-left.

## Tests

- **Rules** (`games/foomerang-fu/test/rules.test.ts`, 89 tests): creation and validation; movement and facing; throw from HELD, the deterministic direction and fallback, duplicate/invalid throw requests; the explicit transition table; travel and range over fixed steps; wall behaviour; homing; reacquisition; enemy, owner, dead-owner, simultaneous, multi-victim and touching-exactly hits; death blocks movement and actions; round end, freezing, the exact reset step, deterministic reset and multi-round play; replay determinism (3,000 steps, identical state, events and JSON); purity; invalid `dt`; garbage movement; a 6,000-step fuzz of invariants.
- **Console** (`fu.test.ts` and friends): the runtime (freshness, activity, throw requests, dedup, stalls, rounds, event delivery) and the pure view model.
- **SDK / controller**: `setButton` (no repeat, no queue, unique ids, interruptions) and the `ActionButton` (every way a press can end releases it).
- **Real sockets** (`integration`): button path through the real SDK and server, including a hostile replay.
- **Browser** (`integration/e2e/fu.e2e.ts`, real Chrome, real touches, real Phaser): two controllers render MOVE + THROW from the manifest → move independently → throw independently (only the thrower's boomerang leaves their hand; Phaser draws it) → aim and kill → round over → the next round starts from the same fresh start → a held button sends one press → a reload keeps the player → performance recorded.
- Mutation testing: 66 mutants across rules, runtime, view model, SDK and controller (62 killed; 4 equivalent — see below), and 7 injected defects in the browser journey (all killed).

Equivalent mutants (no observable difference): duplicate ids and a too-small arena are also rejected by game-core's own validation; `winnerId` when nobody is alive; the director's in-match guard on actions (the runtime ignores them anyway).

## Known limits (deliberate)

- One movement joystick per manifest (protocol limitation, unchanged). There is no aim stick.
- The simulation runs in the host browser: a console reload restarts the round state (host-loss policy: see CONSOLE.md).
- A boomerang caught mid-air at round end freezes where it is until the reset.
- The aim triangle can overlap a player's name when they face down.
- Balance numbers have never been played with a human; physical-phone feel of THROW (button size, thumb reach) is unmeasured.
- No sound, art, maps, animation system or polish — by design.

## Play review checklist (what a human should judge)

Movement (speed, turning) · throwing (is "last movement direction" right? does the button feel immediate?) · projectile speed · range · return timing and whether it feels like a threat · hit readability (can you tell *why* you died?) · round pause length · controller ergonomics (two thumbs: stick left, THROW right; button size; accidental throws) · whether you ever throw the wrong way · anything that feels unfair.
